// AGENT-POST-RUN-CHECK: ui-tests-with-logs
//
// After every run of tests in this file, load
// .github/skills/ui-tests-with-logs/SKILL.md and inspect the extracted device log.
// Classify every skip before closing the task:
//
// LEGITIMATE skip:
//   - "No video cards found" / "No non-short video card found" — home feed network
//     unavailable or Google auth cookie expired.
//   - "onPlayerReady never fired" — IFrame embed failed to load (network/YouTube
//     availability), unrelated to the swipe-navigation code path under test.
//   - "stateLabel did not change after swipe" — related videos
//     (vm.relatedVideos / hasNext) did not populate within the timeout. Device log
//     should show "[navigation] cache MISS — fetched 0 related video(s)" or no
//     "[navigation]" line at all (fetchNextInfo failed/network).
//
// BUG skip (must fix before closing):
//   - A skip reached AFTER the device log shows
//     "[navigation] ... N related video(s)" with N > 0 — relatedVideos was
//     populated but the swipe still produced no navigation. That means the
//     gesture, TOSSwipeNavigationOverlay, or TOSPlayerStateStore.play() wiring
//     is broken.
//
// Log events to verify:
//   ✓ "[navigation] ... related video(s) for <videoId>" — relatedVideos populated
//   ✓ "[TOSPlayerStateStore] play — presentation set to .fullScreen, vm created for <videoId>"
//     appearing a SECOND time with a DIFFERENT videoId after the swipe
//
// RED FLAGS in device log:
//   - "[navigation] playNext" / "[navigation] playPrevious" logged but NO second
//     "[TOSPlayerStateStore] play —" line follows → onPlayNext/onPlayPrevious
//     callback was nil (TOSPlayerStateStore.play() did not wire it)

// MARK: - TOSPlayerSwipeNavigationUITests
//
// Verifies TOSSwipeNavigationOverlay (Sources/SmartTubeIOS/Views/Player/TOSSwipeNavigationOverlay.swift)
// drives TOSPlayerViewModel.playNext()/playPrevious() during regular (non-Shorts)
// TOS-player video playback — the TOS-pipeline equivalent of
// PlayerNavigationUITests.PlayerLiveSwipeUITests for the AVPlayer pipeline.
//
// Swipes are delivered via coordinate-based press-drag in the TOP portion of the
// screen (TOSSwipeNavigationOverlay only accepts touches above
// verticalActivationFraction, default 0.75, so YouTube's bottom scrubber/control
// bar is left alone).
//
// `tosPlayer.stateLabel` only reports playerState (playing/paused/...), not the
// video identity, so a swipe is detected via the Darwin notification
// "com.void.smarttube.tosplayer.ready" firing again for the newly-loaded video —
// "ready" only fires once per TOSPlayerViewModel after its embed reports
// duration > 0 (see TOSPlayerViewModel+WebBridge.swift), so a second "ready"
// firing after a swipe is strong evidence a new vm (and thus a new video) loaded.
