// AGENT-POST-RUN-CHECK: ui-tests-with-logs
//
// After every run of this file, extract device/app logs and inspect.
//
// LEGITIMATE skip:
//   - "Player did not load — network unavailable or video inaccessible"
//     Device log should show: network error or [loadAsync] timeout.
//   - "Prefetch log line not found within timeout — network too slow for prefetch"
//     Device log may show [prefetch] ENQUEUE but no [prefetch] DONE within 15 s.
//
// BUG skip (must fix before closing):
//   - "[prefetch] ENQUEUE" never appears → prefetchQueueVideo() not called
//   - "cache HIT: playerInfo" never appears on second video → prefetch completed
//     too late or was silently swallowed
//
// Log events to verify:
//   ✓ [prefetch] ENQUEUE <nextVideoId> priority=2  (immediate priority)
//   ✓ [prefetch] DONE <nextVideoId>                (prefetch completed)
//   ✓ cache HIT: playerInfo (skipping network)     (second video loaded from cache)
//   ✓ [load] load() called — id=<nextVideoId>      (advance happened)
//
// Performance thresholds:
//   - Prefetch must enqueue within 3 s of first video starting
//   - "cache HIT: playerInfo" must appear for the second video (not a live fetch)
//
// RED FLAGS in device log:
//   - [prefetch] ENQUEUE missing → prefetchQueueVideo() hook not wired
//   - fetchPlayerInfo called for second video → cache miss, prefetch was too slow
//   - priority=0 or priority=1 instead of priority=2 → wrong priority tier used

/// Task #218 — Next-video prefetch cache for queue auto-advance.
///
/// Uses `--uitesting-inject-queue-video-ids=<id1,id2>` to prime the queue
/// with two real videos, then verifies in the device log that:
///  - The second video's PlayerInfo was prefetched at `.immediate` priority
///  - The prefetch completed before auto-advance triggered (cache HIT)
///
/// Performance is measured via XCTMeasure over the time from first video
/// loading to the prefetch ENQUEUE log appearing.
