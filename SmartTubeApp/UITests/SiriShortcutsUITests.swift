// MARK: - SiriShortcutsUITests
//
// UI tests for the Siri Shortcuts deep-link flow implemented in SiriShortcuts.swift.
//
// `OpenYouTubeVideoIntent.perform()` cannot be invoked directly from XCUITest —
// Siri and the Shortcuts app run outside the test process. Instead, these tests
// exercise the exact outcome the intent produces: firing `smarttube://video/<id>`.
//
// The mechanism: AppEntry reads `--uitesting-deeplink-video=<id>` on first
// `.active` scene phase and calls `browseViewModel.deepLinkedVideo = Video(...)`,
// which is the same code path triggered by `handleOpenURL(_:)` when the real
// intent fires the deep link. This simulates the intent's effect deterministically,
// without a network call to open the URL.
//
// What is tested:
//   1. A valid video ID passed via the launch arg opens PlayerView (`player.titleLabel`).
//   2. An empty video ID does not open the player (guard in consumeDeepLinkFromLaunchArgs).
//   3. The launch arg only fires once — re-backgrounding does not reopen the player.
