// MARK: - PlaybackEndAutoplayTests
//
// Regression tests for task #243: when the user's queue (CurrentQueueStore) is
// exhausted at the end of playback, handlePlaybackEnd() must fall through to
// YouTube's recommended videos (relatedVideos) the same way it already does
// when there's no queue at all — instead of unconditionally setting
// videoEnded = true. This matters most for background playback, where the
// user has no UI affordance to manually start the next video.
