// MARK: - WrongVideoStatsOverlayTests
//
// Regression test for task #225: the stats overlay ("Stats for Nerds") showed the
// wrong video ID when the user tapped a new video from the home screen and all
// playback paths failed. The symptom was `videoId = "1B7yg7LWiik"` (previously
// playing video) while `currentVideo.id = "wyBkLyGWZyU"` (the newly selected video).
//
// Root cause: `playerInfo` was not reset to `nil` inside `load()` when switching
// to a different video. The stats-overlay snapshot expression is:
//
//   let videoId = playerInfo?.video.id ?? currentVideo?.id ?? ""
//
// With stale `playerInfo` pointing to the old video, this resolved to the OLD video
// ID even after `currentVideo` had been updated to the new one.
//
// Fix: add `playerInfo = nil` to the clearing block in `PlaybackViewModel+Loading.swift`.
//
// These tests verify the model-layer invariant without an AVPlayer:
//   1. When `playerInfo` is nil, the expression yields `currentVideo?.id`.
//   2. When `playerInfo` is non-nil for a DIFFERENT video, it would have yielded
//      the wrong ID — confirming the bug (and the necessity of the fix).
//   3. When `playerInfo` is non-nil for the SAME video, the expression still yields
//      the correct ID (normal steady-state while playing).
